## General Info
***
<!--Write down the general informations of your project.-->

We model and forecast the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain using _____ recent data from _______ to __________. We use the continuous-time model variation of the SIR model. 
<!--and we include a parameter that comprises the effects of social distancing measures ???-->

Short and long term forecasts show that the social distancing policy imposed by the government is able to flatten the pattern of infection of the COVID-19. However, our results also show that if this policy does not last enough time, it is only able to shift the peak of infection into the future keeping the value of the peak in almost the same value. Furthermore, our long term simulations forecast the optimal date to end the policy. Finally, we show that the proportion of asymptomatic individuals affects the amplitude of the peak of symptomatic infected, suggesting that it is important to test the population.
